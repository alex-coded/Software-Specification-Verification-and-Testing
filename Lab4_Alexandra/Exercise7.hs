-- There is a difference between the symmetric closure of the transitive closure of a relation R and the transitive closure of the symmetric closure of R. In general, these two operations are not the same.

-- To illustrate the difference, consider a simple relation R:

-- R = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)]

-- Let's calculate the symmetric closure of the transitive closure of R:

-- Transitive closure of R (trClos(R)):

-- trClos(R) = [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)]
-- Symmetric closure of trClos(R) (symClos(trClos(R))):

-- symClos(trClos(R)) = [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)]
-- Now, let's calculate the transitive closure of the symmetric closure of R:

-- Symmetric closure of R (symClos(R)):

-- symClos(R) = [(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3)]
-- Transitive closure of symClos(R) (trClos(symClos(R))):

-- trClos(symClos(R)) = [(1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)]
-- As you can see, the results are different. The symmetric closure of the transitive closure and the transitive closure of the symmetric closure do not yield the same relations. The specific relationships included in each closure differ, which demonstrates that the order of these operations matters.

-- So, in general, the order of applying symmetric and transitive closure operations can result in different relations, and they are not equivalent.
